This android docker image is based off https://github.com/circleci/circleci-images.
It has been modified to just produce android docker images.
The goal of this forked repo is to create an android docker image with android emulator support

How to create the docker image:
1) $make -f Makefile
2) $cd android/images
3) select which android api version you want. (ie. $cd android/images/api-25-alpha)
4) $docker build -t {dockerhub-account-name}/{repo-name}:tag <path-to-dockerfile>
ie. $docker build -t minhiew/circleci:0.0.1 ./Dockerfile

How to modify the android image
1) cd android
2) modify Dockerfile.m4
3) run "How to create docker image" steps again

1) https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/custom-images/
